Using patented ozone-free ion technology, it purges 30,000 cubic meters of air an hour by capturing 75 percent of all PM2.5 and PM10 fine haze particles in the air. The tower sends fresh air out at all angles creating a loop of fresh air surrounding it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://imgcdn.yicai.com/uppics/images/2016/10/636126841831604846.jpg\" style=\"height:267px; width:400px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&copy; VCG</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &lsquo;Fight Smog&rsquo; campaign involves a series of public education events promoting an eco-friendly lifestyle. The tour of the smog free tower is an important part of the campaign. The tower is mainly intended as a warning symbol, to remind the public of their responsibility to fight against smog.</p>\r\n
